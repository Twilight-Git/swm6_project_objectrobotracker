# HS Esslingen Project

## Idea
Subject of the present work is a software for controlling an industrial robot arm.
This is done by detecting object movements e.g. a person via a USB Webcam and OpenCV. 
The robot arm follows an detected object.

Its written in C# and uses the cross platform wrapper of OpenCV for .NET Framework.
